The purpose of this program is to help to correctly identify errors within the Excel stock worksheet by putting your stock prices in.

Please note that because excel uses stock prices that are more accurate then a single cent which can cause them to visually round to the next highest cent,
the program and your excel worksheet may vary by about a cent.
